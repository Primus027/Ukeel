80
Tender Documents.
(3) The TEC shall generally follow the procedures detailed below during examination
and evaluation of Tenders -

of all responsive Tenders so that re-submission of evaluation report to the
Approving Authority on the same aspects is not required , should the the lowest
evaluated Tenderer expresses his or her inability to execute the Contract or

post-qualify; ;
(b) all members of the TEC, who participate in the evaluation, shall sign the
Evaluation Report, with their names and designations clearly stated therein;

with his or her own initiative may obtain expert opinion concerning any disputed
matter in the Tender Evaluation Report.
(4) A TEC shall evaluate and compare Tenders that are responsive to the requirements
of Tender Documents in order to identify the successful Tenderer.
(5) A TEC may consider a Tender as responsive in the evaluation, only if it is submitted
in compliance with the mandatory requirements set out in the Tender Document, without material
deviation or reservation.
(6) A material deviation or reservation is one-
(a) which affects in any substantial way the scope, quality, or performance of the
Works;
(b) which limits in any substantial way, inconsistent with the Tender Documents, the
Procuring Entity ’s rights or the Tenderer’s obligations under the Contract; or
(c) whose rectification would affect unfairly the competitive position of other
Tenderers presenting responsive Tenders.
(7) A TEC may regard a Tender as responsive, even if it contains-
(a) minor or insignificant deviations, which do not meaningfully alter or depart from
the technical specifications, characteristics and commercial terms and
conditions or other requirements set out in the Tender Document and any such
deviations shall be quantified in monetary terms, as far as possible;
(b) errors or oversights, which if corrected, would not alter the key aspects of the
Tender.
(8) The Chairperson of a TEC may ask Tenderers for clarifications of their Tenders,
including breakdowns of unit rates, in order to assist the examination and evaluation of the
Tenders, provided that, Tender clarifications which may lead to a change in the substance of the
Tender or in any of the key elements of the Tender, such as price and delivery schedule shall
neither be sought nor accepted by the TEC.
81
(9) Requests for clarification shall be in writing and shall be signed by the Chairperson of
the TEC.
(10) All clarification requests shall remind Tenderers of the need for confidentiality and
that any breach of confidentiality on the part of the Tenderer may result in their Tender being
disqualified.
(11) A TEC shall correct any arithmetic errors that are discovered during the examination
of Tenders, and shall promptly notify the concerned Tenderer(s) of any such correction(s).
(12) The item quantified in the BOQ for which no rates or prices have been quoted shall
be deemed covered by the amounts of other rates and prices in the Contract and it shall not be a
reason to change the Tender price.
(13) If the TEC determines that the Tender pricing is not balanced, the TEC shall require
the Tenderer to submit a detailed price breakdown, and in the case of front loading of the unit
rates the TEC may recommend to increase performance security.
(14) There shall be no requirement for a minimum number of responsive Tenders i.e. an
evaluation shall proceed and an award shall be made even if only a single Tender is received and
found responsive, provided the Tender has been widely advertised as per requirement of Rule 90,
the Tender price is reasonable compared with the market price or is within the official estimate,
and the Tender meets the technical specifications and commercial terms and conditions set-out in
the Tender Document.
(15) A TEC shall not continue to evaluate a Tender when:
(a) the Tenderer has failed to demonstrate its qualifications as required under Rule
49;
(b) the Tenderer does not accept a correction of an arithmetical error made in
accordance with Sub-Rule (11); or
(c) the Tender is not responsive, i.e. the requirements of the qualifications,
technical specifications or financial and commercial terms and conditions set-out
in the Tender Document.
(16) There shall be no consideration during the Tender evaluation of any information
contained in a Tender submission that was not requested in the Tender Document.
(17) For calculating the lowest evaluated price, the TEC shall -
(a) consider all evaluation criteria mentioned in the Tender Document;
(b) ensure that the Tender prices are inclusive of applicable taxes, customs duties
and VAT for national Procurement of Goods, related Services, Works and
Physical Services;
(c) exclude applicable customs duties, taxes and VAT and include inland
transportation costs in the case of CIF Tenders for imported Goods under
international Procurement and exclude only VAT for Goods manufactured
locally;
(d) include applicable customs duties, taxes and VAT for Works Tenders under
international Procurement; and
(e) quantify in monetary terms minor deviations from the evaluation criteria other
than the price following the provisions set in the ITT.
(18) If any Tenderer offered only eighty percent (80%) of the items of a lot, for Tenders
invited on lot-by-lot basis for Goods Procurement, the TEC shall determine the lot price by adding
82
up the average prices offered by other responsive Tenderers for the missing items to the lot value
to establish the winning lot Tender.
(19) If the winning lot Tender under Sub-Rule (18) is missing some items, comprising less
than twenty percent (20%), the Procuring Entity may procure the missing items form the Tenderer
offering the lowest price for the remaining items.
(20) For Works Tenders invited on lot-by-lot basis, the TEC shall award the lots
considering the least cost combination of the lots.
Explanation:
If one Tenderer has won two (2) or more lots and was post-qualified only for one (1) lot,
then he shall be awarded the lot that would result in the least cost of the total value of
contracts and not necessarily the larger lot as he may wish.
(21) For the purpose of evaluation of Tenders involving domestic preference under Rule
83(2), the procedure shall be as follows:
(a) the price quoted for Goods in Tenders from Group A shall be ex-works with or
without transportation and shall include all duties and taxes paid or payable on
the basic materials or components purchased in the domestic market or
imported, but exclude the sales and similar taxes on the finished product;
(b) the price quoted for Goods in Tenders of Group B shall be on CIP or CIF, as
specified in the Tender Document, which is exclusive of customs duties and
other import duties already paid or to be paid;
(c) the lowest evaluated Tender price from each group shall be compared;
(d) if a Tender from Group A is the lowest, that Tender shall be recommended for
award;
(e) if a Tender from Group B has the lowest evaluated Tender price, then it shall be
further compared with the lowest evaluated Tender price in Group A and before
the final comparison is made, the lowest evaluated Tender price in Group B
shall be increased by the percentage for ‘domestic preference’ specified in
Schedule II excluding VAT; and
(f) the lowest evaluated Tender price in Group A shall then be compared with the
lowest evaluated Tender price in Group B and the lowest Tenderer shall be
recommended for award.
(22) The successful Tenderer shall be the Tenderer who submitted a responsive Tender
with the lowest evaluated Tender cost, calculated upon the basis of factors affecting the economic
value of the Tender which have been specified in the Tender Document and to the extent
practicable, these factors shall be objective and quantifiable and shall be given a relative weighting
in the evaluation method or be expressed in monetary terms, wherever practicable.
Example
One of the factors affecting economic value may be the delivery schedule for Goods
or completion schedule for Works. If the delivery or completion schedule for Goods or
Works specified in the Tender Documents is between fifteen (15) and eighteen (18)
months, and a Tenderer bases his or her Tender price on a delivery of twenty (20)
months, then that Tender price may be adjusted for evaluation purpose only, if it is so
specified in the Tender Document, by adding a certain percentage or a lump sum
amount to the Tender price , whereby the percentage or amount for liquidated
damages may be considered as a guidance, for the two (2) month delay beyond
eighteen (18) months. Other factors affecting the true economic value of the Tender
price may be life span costs, such as cost of spare parts, fuel, performance or
productivity of the equipment, etc.
83
(23) If a Tenderer offers a price significantly below the official estimate then the TEC shall
investigate the real reasons behind quoting such a low price and consider the Tender
nonresponsive if -
(a) it becomes very clear that this Tenderer is inexperienced and cannot price a
Tender properly;
(b) the Tenderer cannot provide any justifiable reasons in support of his or her
low price
(24) If the Tenderer quotes a low price because it happens to enjoy some favourable
conditions with respect to this Tender, then the Tender shall be considered as responsive and
evaluated accordingly.
Example 1
A Tenderer has personnel and equipment and has just completed another
contract near the proposed work site.
Example 2
A Tenderer has particular interest in keeping his or her workforce employed
during a low business season.
(25) If, after completing the evaluation, it is found that the lowest evaluated Tender is
significantly higher than the official estimate or available budget or both, but is within an
acceptable range of the market price levels, the TEC may recommend to the Approving Authority
either to accept the Tender, subject to availability of budget or to advise the Procuring Entity to
reduce the scope of the requirements for the concerned Procurement or a reallocation of risks and
responsibility which can be reflected in a reduction of the contract price.
(26) If the Procuring Entity decides to reduce the scope of the requirements under Sub-
Rule (25) for the concerned Procurement it shall -
(a) verify that the lowest Tenderer remains the lowest Tenderer after the scope of
work has been revised by the Procuring Entity;
(b) sign the Contract only with the initial lowest Tenderer; and
(c) ensure that the objective of the Procurement will not be seriously affected
through this reduction.
Example 1
The road authority would recommend reducing the scope of work by
deleting entirely the road safety items which are the last in the BOQ. A
comparison of the impact of these items examined for all responsive
Tenderers may result in the 4th lowest evaluated Tenderer becoming
the lowest. So, the Contract can not be awarded to any Tenderer.
Example 2
The road authority would be satisfied by cancelling one minor road or a
section of the road project. The impact of this reduction shall be
examined for all responsive Tenderers, and may result in the 5th
Tenderer becoming the lowest. So, the Contract can not be awarded to
any Tenderer.
84
(27) If, after completing a Tender evaluation of more than one Tender, a TEC finds there
is only one (1) responsive Tender and the price is close to the official estimate and comparable
with the market price, then the Evaluation Report with the Tender shall be submitted to he
Approving Authority with a recommendation for award of contract following the requirements of
Rule 36.
(28) In the event that the Procuring Entity decides because of a high Tender price to
reduce the scope of the requirements to meet the available budget, the Tenderer is not obliged to
accept the award and shall not be penalised in any way for rejecting the proposed award if the
proposed reduction was not within the scope of any requirement of the Instructions to Tenderers.
(29) A Procuring Entity shall refer a single Tender to a TEC for evaluation in accordance
with the provisions of this Rule, if only one (1) Tender is submitted on the due time and date, and
wide advertisement has been made as per the requirements of Rule 90.
(30) If the single Tender is found in the evaluation to be fully compliant with the Tender
Document and the price is close to the official estimate and comparable with the market price, then
the Evaluation Report including Tender may be submitted to the Approving Authority with a
recommendation for award of contract following the provisions of Rule 36 , appropriately
explaining in the Evaluation Report the rationale for accepting the single Tender.
(31) In the extremely unlikely event that there is a tie for the lowest evaluated price, the
Tenderer with the superior past performance with the Procuring Entity shall be selected, whereby
factors such as delivery period, quality of Goods or Works delivered, litigation history and
performance indicators could be taken into consideration.
(32) In the event that there is a tie for the lowest evaluated price and none of the
Tenderers has past performance with the Procuring Entity, then the Tenderer shall be selected
after consideration of the following , subject to firm confirmation through the Post-Qualification
process described in Rule 100.
(a) in the case of a Works contract, the Tenderer has demonstrated in its Tender,
superior past performance with other Procuring Entities or a more efficient work
programme and work methodology
(b) in the case of a Goods contract, the quality of Goods that is considered more
advantageous by the end-users
(33) The successful Tenderer under Sub-Rule (31) shall not be selected by lottery under
any circumstance.
(34) All Documents related to the evaluation proceedings shall be kept in safe custody in
an office of the Procuring Entity that can only be accessed by members of the TEC.
99. No Negotiation or Tender Modification as a Pre-condition for Award. |— (1) No
negotiations shall be held during the Tender Evaluation or award with the lowest or any other
Tenderer except under -
(a) the Direct Procurement Method; or
(b) in the case of a Procurement of divisible commodity in bulk such as food grains,
sugar, cooking oil, fuel, animal feed, fertilizer etc., and subject to a provision in
the invitation for Tender for supply of a partial quantity of any such commodity
then:
(i) if the lowest responsive Tenderer does not submit a Tender for the entire
quantity of commodity specified in the Tender, first of all, the lowest
Tenderer may be given an offer to supply the entire quantity for which the
Tender was invited at its quoted price or
(ii) in case it expresses its inability to supply the entire quantity , supply of the
reduced quantity it tendered shall be obtained from it, and
85
(iii) offerings for Procurement of the balance quantity may be made to
Tenderers in turn to the second, the third and, other next responsive
Tenderers as deemed appropriate at the price quoted by the lowest
responsive Tenderer, provided that under no circumstances shall
negotiations be held to change the lowest responsive price and that the
total quantity to be procured following the provisions of this Rule shall not
exceed the quantity for which the original Tender was invited.
(c) it is found that the lowest evaluated Tender is significantly higher than the
official estimate the Procuring Entity will investigate the reasons for the higher
price and may negotiate with the lowest evaluated Tenderer with objective to
reduce the Contract price by reducing the scope of works or a reallocation of
risks and responsibility. which can be reflected in a reduction of the contract
price.

CHAPTER SIX
PROCUREMENT OF INTELLECTUAL AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES
PART – 1
METHODS AND PROCEDURES
103. Methods for Procurement of Intellectual and Professional Services and their
Use. |— 1) The prime consideration in the selection of the successful Consultant in the
Procurement of intellectual and professional Services shall be given to the quality of a Consultant's
Technical Proposal.
(2) The cost of the Services shall be considered judiciously because in the Procurement
of intellectual and professional Services in general, if cost considerations predominate in the
evaluation, the quality of the resulting Services often ends up being inferior which in turn places
further cost burdens on the Procuring Entity due to rework being needed or less economical
solutions being recommended.
(3) The Procuring Entity shall encourage the involvement of national Consultants in
assignments with international competition.
(4) Depending on the nature and complexity of assignments, different methods as
specified in this part of these Rules may be used, but the following two (2) methods shall be the
preferred options for selection of Consultants -
(a) Quality & Cost Based Selection (QCBS) is the preferred method that shall be
used in most cases and shall take into account-
(i) the quality of the Proposal; and
(ii) the cost of the Services.
(b) Selection under a Fixed Budget (SFB) is appropriate only when -
(i) the assignment is relatively simple and can be precisely defined; and
(ii) the budget is fixed.
(5) The Procuring Entity shall publish in its website the name of the Consultant to which
the Contract was awarded, price, duration and scope of the Contract.
(6) General considerations for employment of national and international Consultants are
provided for in Schedule IX .
104. Other Methods for Procurement of Intellectual and Professional Services.|—
Other methods for Procurement of intellectual and professional Services may also be used under
the conditions set-out in the following paragraphs and with the prior written approval of the Head of
a Procuring Entity or an officer authorized by him or her:
(a) Least Cost Selection (LCS)
(i) is appropriate for the selection of Consultants for an assignment of a
standard or routine nature such as audits, architectural and engineering
designs of non-complex Works, where established practices and
standards exist and in which the Contract amount is small as specified in
Schedule II.
(ii) The Procuring Entity shall use the procedures specified in Rule 107.
(b) Selection Based on Consultant’s Qualifications (SBCQ)
89
(i) The Procuring Entity may consider using SBCQ for very small
assignments, for which the cost of a full-fledged selection process would
not be justified, such as -
a. brief evaluation studies at critical decision points of projects
(review of alternative solutions with large downstream effects);
b. executive assessment of strategic plans;
c. high level, short-term legal expertise; and
d. participation in project review expert panels.
(ii) The Procuring Entity shall use the procedures specified in Rule 108.
(c) Selection amongst Community Service Organisations (CSOs)
(i) may be used by short-listing reputable Non-Governmental Organisations
(NGOs), other community service organisations or voluntary non-profit
organisations that are well qualified to assist in the preparation, management
and implementation of community development projects or programmes
because of their involvement and knowledge of local issues, community needs
or participatory approaches.
(ii) The Procuring Entity shall use the procedures specified in Rule 109.
(d) Single Source Selection (SSS) of firms or individual consultants
(1) (SSS) may be used only in exceptional cases as specified in this Rule
because it -
a. does not provide the benefits of competition in regard to quality and
cost,
b. lacks transparency in selection, and
c. could encourage unacceptable and fraudulent practices.
(2) It may be appropriate only if it presents a clear advantage over competition
-
a. where a rapid selection is essential (for example, in an emergency
operation),
b. for very small assignments within the threshold specified in Schedule
II;
c. when only one (1) firm or an individual Consultant is qualified or has
experience of exceptional worth for the assignment; and
(3) It may also be appropriate for tasks that represent a natural continuation of
previous work carried out by the Consultant; where an initial consultancy
assignment needs to be continued and where continuity of the technical
approach, experience acquired and continued professional liability of the
same Consultant may make such continuation preferable to a new
competition; and in such cases the initially selected Consultant may be
allowed to continue with the subsequent assignment provided that -
a. the initial assignment was performed satisfactorily; and
b. the need for such downstream assignment was anticipated in the
initial Request for Proposal.
(4) if the initial assignment was not awarded on a competitive basis or if the
downstream assignment is substantially larger in value, a competitive
process shall be followed and in such cases the Consultant carrying out
90
the initial work shall not be excluded from consideration provided it
expresses interest.
(5) the Head of the Procuring Entity, or the Approving Authority where it is a
higher body than that of the Head of the Procuring Entity, may consider
exceptions to Sub Rule (d) (iv) under special circumstances and only
when a new competitive process is not practicable.
(6) UnitedNations agencies may be invited where they are exceptionally well-
qualified to provide technical assistance and advice in the area of
expertise, on a case-by-case basis.
(7) The Procuring Entity shall use the procedures specified in Rule 110.
(8) Variation Orders to consultancy contracts shall not exceed the limit
specified in Schedule II, unless approved by an authority of level higher
than that of the initial Approving Authority as explained in Rule 74 (4).
(e) Selection of Consultants by a Design Contest (DC): The Procuring Entity
shall use the procedures specified in Rule 111.
(f) Selection of Individual Consultants The Procuring Entity shall use the
procedures laid down in Rule 112.
105. Procedures for Selection under the Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS)
Method. |— (1) The procedures of QCBS are as follows and are further detailed in Part 2 of this
Chapter -
(a) a Request for Expressions of Interest (EOI) as laid down in Rule 113 is
advertised to invite interested Applicants in order to prepare a shortlist of
Applicants;
(b) a Request for Proposals (RFP) shall be prepared and sent to short-listed
Consultants selected following the provisions of Rule 117;
(c) after receiving the Proposals the PEC shall meet to evaluate the Proposals;
(d) the evaluation of Proposals shall be carried out in two (2) stages in the following
manner -
(i) the Technical Proposals shall be evaluated;
(ii) the financial Proposals of technically responsive Proposals shall be
opened in the presence of the Applicants or their representatives who
wish to attend;
(iii) a combined evaluation of Technical and Financial Proposals shall follow
and the Applicant with the winning Proposal will be invited to negotiations.
(2) In the case of Procurement of intellectual and professional services under Quality and
Cost Based Selection (QCBS) Method process and proceedings in flow-charts as specified in Part-
G of Schedule III shall be followed.
106. Procedures for Selection under a Fixed Budget (SFB). |— (1) The Procedures to
be followed for the SFB Method shall be the same as for the Quality and Cost Based Method, with
the following exceptions, namely -
(a) the RFP shall indicate the available budget excluding taxes and ask the
Applicants to provide, in separate envelopes, their best Technical and Financial
Proposals within the budget;
(b) the TOR shall be as complete as possible to make sure that the budget is
sufficient for the Consultants to perform the expected tasks;
91
(c) the RFP shall require the Applicants to provide breakdowns of their costs for
the different activities with a provision that Applicants who decline to provide the
breakdown risk the rejection of their Proposals;
(d) the RFP shall state that, following opening of Proposals, all Proposals that
exceed the indicated budget shall be rejected and the Applicant who has
submitted the highest ranked Technical Proposal among the rest shall be
selected and invited to negotiate the Contract.
(2) In the case of Procurement of intellectual and professional services under Fixed
Budget (SFB) Method process and proceedings in flow-charts as specified in Part-H of Schedule
III shall be followed.
107. Procedures for Selection under Least Cost Selection (LCS). |— (1) The
procedures to be followed for the LCS method shall be the same as for the QCBS Method except
that -
(a) the RFP shall state that following evaluation of Technical Proposals and
opening of Financial Proposals, the Applicant offering the lowest evaluated price
shall be selected for negotiations, as described in Rule 122;
(b) under this method Proposals passing the technical score threshold shall then
be treated equally and evaluated on the basis of cost only.
(2) In the case of Procurement of intellectual and professional services under Least Cost
Selection (LCS) Method process and proceedings in flow-charts as specified in Part-I of Schedule
III shall be followed.
108. Procedures for Selection of Consultants Based on Consultant’s Qualifications
(SBCQ). |— (1) The Procuring Entity shall select the Consultants with the best possible
qualifications, since very small assignments may be very important and could be highly specialized
advisory Services with a limited scope and duration.
(2) The Procuring Entity shall not disregard quality while aiming to reduce the cost and
time needed to hire a Consultant.
(3) The Procuring Entity shall first prepare the TOR and then request the Expressions of
Interest and qualification information on the Consultants’ experience and competence relevant to
the assignment from Consultants in the data base.
(4) The Procuring Entity shall establish a short-list and select the firm with the best
qualifications and references.
(5) The procedures to be followed for the SBCQ Method shall be the same as for the
QCBS Method except that only the selected firm shall be asked to submit a combined Technical
and Financial Proposal and will then be invited to negotiate the Contract if the Technical Proposal
proves acceptable.
109. Procedures for Selection amongst Community Service Organisations (CSOs).
|— (1) Selection of CSOs can follow any of the Quality and Cost Based Selection, Least Cost
Selection, Selection under a Fixed Budget (SFB) or Single Source Selection (SSS) Methods,
depending on the size of the assignment and the knowledge of the inputs required.
(2) A modified version of the SFB Method may be used whereby CSOs need only to
submit a technical offer since the financial part is predetermined by the Procuring Entity along with
the priced activities already given in the RFP.
(3) Under this type of selection, implementation aspects of community activities and
experience and local knowledge may carry more points compared to those used in normal QCBS,
LCS, SFB or SSS Methods.
92
110. Procedures for Selection under Single Source Selection (SSS). |— (1) The
justification for SSS shall be examined in the context of the overall interests of the Procuring
Entity to ensure economy and efficiency and provide equal opportunity to Consultants; therefore
the decision to use SSS Method shall be approved in writing by the Head of a Procuring Entity, or
an officer authorised by him or her, and documented.
(2) The selected Consultant shall be issued the RFP or TOR, as the case may be, and
shall be requested to submit a Technical and Financial Proposal upon the receipt of which
negotiations shall be held between the Proposal Evaluation Committee and the selected
Consultant and all aspects of its Proposal, whether technical or financial, shall be discussed
together in order to reach an agreement.
(3) When continuity for downstream work is essential, the initial RFP shall outline this
prospect.
(4) For such downstream assignments, the Procuring Entity shall ask the initially selected
Consultant to prepare technical and financial Proposals on the basis of the TOR furnished by the
Procuring Entity, which shall then be negotiated.
(5) In cases where an agency of the United Nations Organisation is selected as a
Consultant under this method, a special form of Contract reflecting the privileges and immunities
granted by the Government to UN agencies and their staff will be used.
(6) When UN agencies are engaged under this method, standard RFP may be adjusted
to suit the requirement.
(7) In the case of Procurement of intellectual and professional services under Single
Source Selection (SSS) Method process and proceedings in flow-charts as specified in Part-J of
Schedule III shall be followed.
111. Procedures for Selection of Consultants by a Design Contest (DC). |— (1)
Carrying out a Design Contest is a selection method under which short-listed firms, in general
architectural firms, are invited to submit their conceptual design for a physical project, such as a
monument, research centre, office headquarters or transportation terminal.
(2) The conceptual design forming the main output of the DC is expected to highlight the
aesthetic aspects of the project in addition to its technical characteristics.
(3) The Procuring Entity shall either draw up a short-list of prospective Applicants on the
basis of experience, capability and reputation; or if it has difficulty developing a good short-list, it
may widely advertise the Design Contest and invite Expressions of Interest from firms that believe
themselves qualified.
(4) The Procuring Entity shall send the short-listed Applicants a Request for Design
Proposals including a letter of invitation, project information to proponents including a data sheet to
address specific features and a TOR composed of the design criteria, and other data as relevant.

preliminary conceptual design and related cost estimate responding to the request for design
Proposal Documents.
93
(7) The Proposal Opening Committee shall, after all Proposals have been received and
opened, forward the Proposals to the Procuring Entity in a closed box for safe custody as per Rule
32.
(8) Upon receipt of the Proposals, the Proposal Evaluation Committee shall proceed with
the evaluation of the proposed designs in accordance with the broad evaluation criteria spelled out
in the Request for Design Proposals and submit the Evaluation Report in accordance with Rule
119.
(9) The winning conceptual design, being by its nature preliminary, shall be followed in
the case the project continues, by detailed engineering design, Bill of Quantities, Technical
Specifications and Tender Documents and a Contract for supervision of the construction.
(10) The winning Consultant shall be asked to submit a combined Technical and
Financial Proposal and will then be invited to negotiate the Contract if the Technical Proposal
proves acceptable.
(11) The Request for Design Proposal Document may provide for awarding a prize to the
successful Consultant which may consist of the Contract for the subsequent design phase(s) of
the project plus a pre-determined monetary award, and smaller monetary awards to the second
and third evaluated Applicants to partially offset the expenditures they have incurred, if their
Proposals are considered as close runners in the competition.
(12) The standard Request for Proposal Document may need to be adjusted to suit the
specific requirements of the competition.
112. Selection of Individual Consultants (SIC). |— (1) Individual Consultants may be
employed in accordance with Section 38 of the Act for assignments for which the qualifications
and experience of the individual are the overriding requirement and no team of staff and no

comparison of qualifications and experience of the candidates who have expressed interest in the
assignment or have been approached directly by the Procuring Entity.
(3) Individuals shall demonstrate in their EOI that they meet the required qualifications
and experiences and are fully capable of carrying out the assignment.
(4) The capability of individuals shall be judged on the basis of academic background,
experience in the field of assignment, and as appropriate, knowledge of the local conditions, as
well as language and culture.
(5) Following the completion of the evaluation of the Applicants’ qualifications, the short-
listed Applicants may be invited for interviews and the selected Applicant will then be invited to
negotiate fees or remuneration, Reimbursables, the inputs available from the Procuring Entity, etc.,
and subsequently to sign the Contract.
(6) In order to select the most suitable candidate efficiently within a reasonable budget,
the Procuring Entity may prepare a list of alternate candidates in order of priority.
(7) A large number of individuals shall not be employed to carry out a wider task if co-
ordination, administration or collective responsibility becomes difficult and hiring of firm(s) would
become more convenient.
(8) General considerations for appointment of Bangladeshi nationals as individual
Consultants are shown in Schedule V.
(9) Terms and conditions for the employment of Government servants and employees of
94
autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies, corporations or other statutory bodies or local

submit an EOI by the due date and time and to the place specified in the advertisement.
(6) Whenever a Joint Venture, Consortium or Association (JVCA) arrangement between
national and foreign firms would be thought to facilitate performance of high quality Services, the
Request for Expressions of Interest should mention that such JVCA formed as per Rule 54 would
be welcomed or encouraged by the Procuring Entity, provided that, a Procuring Entity cannot
make formation of such a JVCA a mandatory requirement in the RFP.

to make appropriate amendments to the assignment to make it more attractive to the consulting
industry and then re-advertise the Request, but ensuring a wider publicity, provided that Procuring
Entities shall not resort to the practice of re-advertisement as a routine matter, but instead should
always make efforts to invite Requests for Expressions of Interest that will enable them to finalise
adequate short-lists in the first round of advertisement.
(8) If after re-advertising under the proviso to Sub-Rule (7) , the number of re-assessed
and short-listed Applicants is still less than four (4), the short-list should be considered as final and

(i) the Contract format to be used in which the respective obligations of both the
Consultant and the Procuring Entity shall be stated.
(3) The RFP shall consist of -
(i) Letter of Invitation (LOI) including the short-list;
(ii) Instructions to Applicants or Consultants (ITA or ITC) as the case may be;
(iii) Proposal Data Sheet (PDS);
(iv) General Conditions of Contract (GCC);
(v) Particular Conditions of Contract (PCC);
(vi) Standard Contract Form;
(vii) Terms of Reference (TOR); and
(viii) Appendices.
(4) The Procuring Entity shall use only the applicable standard RFPs most suitable for
each case.
(5) The Procuring Entity shall normally not change the standard RFP Document and any
specific issues shall be addressed in the Proposal Data Sheet and in the Particular Conditions of
Contract.
(6) The LOI shall state the intention of the Procuring Entity to enter into a Contract for the
provision of consulting Services, the source of funds, the details of the beneficiary entity, the list of
short-listed Consultants and the date, time and address for submission of Proposals.
(7) The Procuring Entity shall list in the LOI all the Documents to be included in the RFP.
(8) The ITA or ITC shall contain all necessary information to help Applicants prepare
98
responsive Proposals and to make the selection procedure as fair and as transparent as possible
by providing information on the Proposal submission process and the evaluation criteria.
(9) If a short-listed Consultant could derive a competitive advantage from having
provided consulting Services related to the assignment in question, the Procuring Entity shall
make available to all short-listed Consultants together with the RFP all information that would in
that respect give such Consultant any competitive advantage over competing Consultants such as
designs, study reports, strategy papers.
(10) The ITA or ITC shall specify the Proposal validity, within the period specified in
Schedule I, depending on the complexity of the assignment,
provided that to suit the requirements of a particular Procurement transaction shorter or
longer periods may be authorised by the Head of a Procuring Entity or an officer authorised by him
or her.
(11) The Procuring Entity shall prepare a realistic cost estimate in order to allocate an
accurate budget to the assignment.
(12) The Procuring Entity may break down the assignment into its composite tasks
(activities), if applicable, with each task showing the professional fees required and corresponding
Reimbursables and a contingency, if desired, to provide for both physical and financial
contingencies.
(13) The cost estimate prepared by the Applicant shall be based on the Procuring Entity’s
assessment of the resources needed to carry out the assignment including staff-months, logistical
support and physical inputs.
(14) Costs shall be generally divided into two (2) broad categories -
(a) fees or remuneration according to the type of Contract used; and
(b) Reimbursables, in the case of time-based contracts, which are amounts
payable against Documentary evidence for expenses such as air tickets, per
diems, visa costs, medical expenses, transportation costs, office rental costs,
purchase of vehicles, office equipment, office furniture, etc.
(15) The cost of staff-months shall be estimated on a realistic basis in accordance with
the level of expertise required and the desired proportion of international and national Consultants.
(16) The items listed in Sub-Rule (14)(b) as reimbursable expenditures are examples only
and shall vary according to the TOR and, in particular, the facilities to be provided to the
Consultant by a Procuring Entity or user or beneficiary entity;
Example
If a Procuring Entity or user or beneficiary entity can provide office equipment,
vehicles or both then there shall be no need for an Applicant to include those items
in its estimate of costs.
(17) The only actual fixed cost quoted by an Applicant in its Proposal is the fee rate or
remuneration to be charged for its personnel to undertake the assignment.
(18) For certain specific Services, such as for pre-shipment inspection, Procurement
Agency Services, training of students in institutes or universities, advertising activities in
privatisation or twinning, the Procuring Entity may need to adjust the formats or tables in the
Standard RFP Document issued by the CPTU.
(19) Applicants shall be given at least the minimum time for preparation of Proposals
99
specified in Schedule II.
(20) The RFP shall indicate the time periods whereby the Procuring Entity can entertain
any request by an Applicant for clarification as well as the timing of the issue of the corresponding
response.
(21) The Request for Proposal may be sent to the short-listed Applicants by e-mail or by
courier.
(22) Considering the nature of a clarification requested it may become necessary to
extend the deadline for submission of Proposals and such clarification shall also be issued to all
short-listed Applicants.
(23) If a pre-Proposal meeting is intended to clarify any issues, the time and date of the
pre-Proposal meeting shall be specified in the PDS.
(24) The RFP for QCBS shall consider the following when defining the evaluation criteria -
(a) Cost, as a criterion of selection, shall be considered judiciously and shall be of
lesser importance in the evaluation of Proposals than the quality of the
Proposals and the qualifications of the Applicant;
(b) the relative weight to be given to quality and cost shall be determined on a case-
by-case basis depending upon the nature of the assignment and could be
divided between quality and price as high as eighty percent and twenty percent
(80% and 20%) respectively where, in cases like multidisciplinary, feasibility and
management studies, the intellectual and professional quality of the Consultant
is overriding;
(c) the minimum point to be achieved in the Technical Proposal evaluation shall be
seventy (70);
(d) Technical Proposals not achieving the minimum technical points required shall
be considered not suitable and their Financial Proposals shall be returned
unopened to the Applicant;
(e) for standard types of Services such as pre-shipment and other inspection
Services, Procurement Services, training of students in universities, and the like,
where adequate quality is normally guaranteed by business or regulatory
standards, the weighting between quality and price could be sixty-five percent
and thirty-five percent (65% and 35%,) sixty percent and forty percent (60% and
40%,) fifty-five percent and forty-five percent (55% and 45%) or even as low as
fifty percent and fifty percent (50% and 50%), whereby the LCS Method can
also be relevant; and
(f) since cost is a criterion in the evaluation of Proposals, the RFP shall not state
the budget or official estimate for the assignment that has been allocated by
either the Procuring Entity or user or beneficiary entity, but it shall indicate the
estimated or expected level of inputs of key professional staff, staff time being
expressed in person-months or weeks or days, that is considered necessary to
undertake the assignment in order to enable the Applicant to prepare its own
cost estimate to carry out the assignment.
(25) The following five (5) general criteria may be used to evaluate Technical Proposals -
(a) Specific experience of the Applicants;
(b) Adequacy of the proposed methodology and work plan in response to the TOR;
(c) Key staff’s qualifications and competence for the assignment;
(d) Suitability of the transfer of knowledge programme, i.e. training, where there is,
100
such a programme; and
(e) National participation, i.e. the extent to which nationals have been included
among key staff; where applicable.
(26) When determining the points to each criterion under Su-Rule (25), the Procuring
Entity shall consider -
(a) the points given to experience can be relatively low, since this factor has already
been taken into account when short-listing the Applicant;
(b) in the case of complex assignments, such as multidisciplinary, feasibility or
management studies, more points should be given to the methodology and work
plan and similarly higher points may be preferable for key staff in assignments
where personnel input is of paramount importance;
(c) transfer of knowledge may be more important in some assignments and in such
cases, it should be given higher points to reflect its importance; and
(d) when RFPs are issued on an international basis, points can be awarded for the
use of national Consultants as key staff and generally the maximum number of
points available shall be ten (10).

(c) It is desirable that the majority of the key professional staff proposed be permanent
employees of the firm or have an extended and stable working relationship with it;
(d) The curricula vitae shall be signed by the individual Consultants and dated;
(e) It is essential to ensure accuracy in the curricula vitae and commitment of key
staff submitted with the proposals;
(f) A key professional shall not be proposed by more than one Firm, except for a
nominated subconsultant; and
(g) Non-compliance with these important requirements will result in rejection of the
101
proposal.
(2) For opening the Technical Proposals, the Procuring Entity shall convene the meeting
of the Proposal Opening Committee (POC) constituted under Rule 7.
(3) The Financial Proposals shall be kept closed in the safe custody of the Head of the
Procuring Entity until such time as the evaluation of technical Proposals has been completed.
(4) A POC shall send the Technical Proposals and the record of opening in a closed box
though the Procuring Entity to the Proposal Evaluation Committee constituted under Rule 8, for
evaluation.
PART-3
EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS, NEGOTIATIONS AND COMPLETION OF THE
PROCESS
119. Evaluation of Technical Proposals. |— (1) A Proposal Evaluation Committee (PEC)
shall evaluate all Technical Proposals, in accordance with the RFP and the relevant provisions of
the Act and these Rules.
(2) If Proposals are received or invited from Applicants with whom member(s) of the PEC
have business or other close links, such member(s) shall be replaced, in order to avoid conflicts of
interest.
(3) Under QCBS (Quality and Cost Based Selection), SFB (Selection under Fixed
Budget); LCS (Least Cost Selection), the First Stage of the evaluation shall involve only an
examination and evaluation of the Technical Proposals and such evaluation shall be carried out by
the PEC as specified in the RFP.
(4) The PEC members themselves shall evaluate each Proposal on the basis of its
responsiveness to the TOR, and a Proposal shall be considered unsuitable or non-responsive and
it shall be rejected if it does not respond to important aspects of the TOR or if it fails to achieve the
minimum technical point specified in the RFP.
(5) Once technical proposals are received and opened, consultants shall not be required
nor permitted to change the substance of the Proposal, the key staff, and so forth.
(6) In the event that only one (1) Proposal achieves the minimum technical point , then
with the approval of the Head of the Procuring Entity, or an officer authorised by him or her or an
Approving Authority (if the Approving Authority is below the level of the Head of the Procuring
Entity), the Financial Proposal will be opened and examined.
(7) A Procuring Entity shall forward a single Proposal to the PEC for evaluation if only
one (1) is submitted on the due date and time, provided that all short-listed Applicants have been
requested to submit Proposals allowing the time specified in the RFP.
(8) Each member of the PEC shall evaluate separately each Proposal, and then the point
for each Proposal will be calculated as the average of the points given by all members of the PEC
for the respective Proposal.
(9) In the case of major differences in the points assigned by an individual evaluator, the
Chairperson shall look into the differences and ask the concerned individual evaluator to explain
and justify his points provided that,
(a) if his justification has no convincing grounds, his evaluation shall be discarded;
102
(b) if his justification has convincing grounds and the evaluator turns out to be the
only one mastering the subject, a new PEC shall be assembled in which the
individual evaluator will be a member.
(10) A Proposal Evaluation Report shall be prepared clearly indicating the technical points
attributed to each Proposal, in order to identify Applicants who have achieved the required
minimum technical points and who shall be considered in the combined technical and financial
evaluation.
(11) The Technical Evaluation Report shall be submitted to the Head of the Procuring
Entity, an officer authorised by him or her or an Approving Authority (if the Approving Authority is
below the level of the Head of the Procuring Entity) in the same manner as under Rule 36.
120. Evaluation of Financial Proposals. |— (1) Upon approval of the technical
Evaluation Report by the Head of the Procuring Entity, or an officer authorised by him or her or an
Approving Authority (if the Approving Authority is below the level of the Head of the Procuring
Entity), the Applicants who attained at least the minimum technical points specified in the RFP
shall be invited to a public opening of their Financial Proposals.
(2) At the public opening, the PEC shall announce the technical points for each Proposal
which has achieved the minimum technical points , together with its respective price.
(3) The financial Proposal shall be checked to verify that it is arithmetically correct and
any errors in calculation shall be notified to the Applicant.
(4) If pricing of activities was required, activities and items described in the Technical
Proposal but not priced shall be assumed to be included in the prices of other activities or items.
(5) Where an activity or line item is quantified in the Financial Proposal differently from
the Technical Proposal, the Evaluation Committee shall correct the quantification indicated in the
Financial Proposal so as to make it consistent with that indicated in the Technical Proposal.
Example
i f a Technical Proposal indicates the presence of the team leader at the assignment
s ite for twelve (12) months and the Financial Proposal indicates only eight (8)
m onths,, an adjustment should be calculated by adding the corresponding amount
o f staff remuneration to the proposed amount.
(6) Reimbursable items priced by the Applicants shall be reviewed both for arithmetical
errors and content and if it is determined that an item has been included that is not required by the
Consultant, it shall be omitted from the Proposal and not considered in the financial evaluation.
Example
The Consultant has priced office rent while the RFP indicates that the Procuring
Entity or the beneficiary entity will provide it.
(7) In the case of Lump-Sum Form of Contract, no corrections shall be applied to the
Financial Proposal.
121. Combined Technical and Financial Evaluation for QCBS. |— (1) The technical
score shall be calculated in the combined Technical and Financial Evaluation as shown in the
following example:
Example
If a Technical Proposal achieved ninety (90) points and the weighting applied to
103
this was eighty percent (80%), then by applying this weighting the technical score of
the proposal would be ninety times eighty percent equals seventy-two (90 x 80% =
72).
(2) The financial score of each Proposal shall be determined in a manner so as to ensure
that the Financial Proposal with the lowest evaluated cost is given one hundred (100) points and
other Proposals pro-rata points, reduced by the same percentage that the cost of their Proposal is
higher than that of the lowest cost Proposal.
Example
I f the lowest cost Financial Proposal is say Tk. one (1.0) million, then the financial
p oints awarded to it would be one hundred (100) (the maximum) and the resulting
financial scores would then be:
Proposals Cost Points Weight Score
Lowest Financial Proposal Tk. 1.0 million 100 20% 20
Next highest Financial Proposal Tk. 1.2 million 83.3 20% 16.66
Next higher Financial Proposal Tk. 1.5 million 66.6 20% 13.32
(3) The technical score plus the financial score gives the combined score and the
Consultant with the highest combined score shall be invited for Contract negotiations.
122. Negotiations. |— (1) Upon completion of the Evaluation of the Proposals, a PEC
shall -
(a) in the case of Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) Method, review the
combined Technical and Financial Evaluation Report and invite the Consultant
that scored the highest in the combined Technical and Financial Evaluations for
negotiations;
(b) in the case of Fixed Budget Selection (FBS) Method, invite the Consultant that
submitted the highest ranked Technical Proposal within the budget for
negotiations;
(c) in the case of the Least Cost Selection (LCS) Method, invite the Consultant that
quoted the lowest price among those who passed the minimum technical points
for negotiations.
(2) The Procuring Entity shall notify the successful Consultant that its Proposal has been
accepted and shall set a date for the commencement of Contract negotiations so that the Contract
can come into force before the prescribed Proposal validity date expires.
(3) A Proposal Evaluation Committee shall, in order to conclude a Contract, negotiate
with the successful Consultant only on the following components of its Proposal:
(a) Methodology;
(b) Work plan and activity schedule;
(c) Organisation and staffing;
(d) Deliverables;
(e) Training inputs, if training is a major component;
(f) Client or Procuring Entity's inputs;
(g) Reimbursables, in the case of time-based Contracts; and
104
(h) Proposed Contract price.
(4) A PEC shall neither seek nor permit changes in the rates quoted for staff
remuneration proposed by an Applicant in selection methods where the Applicant’s price is used
as a factor in the evaluation.
(5) The PEC may require the consultant to substitute a key staff, if it was found during
Evaluation that he is not fit enough for the proposed assignment.
(6) If an extension of validity of proposals was the reason that key staff were not
available for a Firm, a change of key staff with equivalent or better qualification may be permitted.
(7) During negotiations special attention shall be paid to defining clearly the inputs and
facilities offered by the Procuring Entity.
(8) Negotiations shall include discussions about the TOR but shall not significantly alter
the original TOR so that the integrity of the negotiations and the content and findings of the
technical Evaluation Report cannot be called into question.
(9) Major reductions in work inputs shall not be made solely to meet the budget.
123. Failure of Negotiations and Rejection of All Proposals. |— (1) If negotiations fail
and all Proposals are found to be non-responsive and unsuitable, the Procuring Entity may, with
the approval of the Head of the Procuring Entity, reject them under the following grounds -
(a) The Proposals present major deficiencies in responding to the RFP.
(b) The Cost Proposals are substantially higher than the estimated budget and
could not be bridged during negotiations.
Example 1
The Procuring Entity and Consultants disagree on which contractual party
should be responsible for executing specific assignment activities, or on the
exact content of the assignment or feasibility of specific deadlines affecting the
implementation schedule of the project.
Example 2
Consultants may find the estimated man-months and the distribution of risks
unacceptable. The Consultants may then present cost Proposals that are
substantially higher than the available budget. The Procuring Entity may be
unaware of the actual remuneration levels of the Consultants for the type of
(2) Before rejecting all Proposals, the Head of the Procuring Entity should investigate the
Services being considered, the Consultants may misinterpret the TOR, or the
feasibility of increasing the budget or scaling down the scope of Services to meet the original
Procuring Entity’s plans may be too ambitious for the available budget.
budget.
(3) If the Head of the Procuring Entity decides finally to reject all Proposals, the
Procuring Entity shall reassess the proposed TOR and budget and undertake an accurate review
of the RFP (including the short-list) to reduce the risks of non-responsive Proposals.
124. Approval Process. |— (1) The Evaluation Report along with its recommendations
and minutes of the completed negotiations shall be submitted to the Approving Authority in the
manner as prescribed under Rule 36.
(2) The Approving Authority, as described in the Delegation of Financial Powers issued
by the Government from time to time, shall consider the Evaluation Report and the
recommendations as submitted by the PEC and take a decision in accordance with Rule 11.
105
(3) The Approving Authority shall communicate its decision to the Head of the Procuring
Entity and others concerned.
125. Signing of Contract. |— (1) The PEC and the successful Consultant shall, in order to
conclude the negotiations, sign the agreed minutes of negotiations and initial the proposed draft
Contract agreement.
(2) A Procuring Entity shall upon receipt of the approval for the signing of the Contract,
and provided that no complaint has been lodged or is still under consideration under Rules 57, 59
and 60, invite the successful Consultant to sign the Contract.
(3) The type of Contract shall be as specified in the RFP, i.e. Time-based or Lump Sum
Contract.
(4) The Consultant receiving an award of Contract shall not be required to submit any
performance security.
(5) The Procuring Entity shall assure that a necessary provision have been included in
the RFP to the effect that the Consultant shall be contractually obligated, in the event their
performance of the Services does not meet the standards and requirements set in the Contract, to
re-perform the Services at their own expense or to indemnify the Procuring Entity for losses that it
may suffer.
126. Completion of the Process. |— (1) A Procuring Entity shall, following the signing of
the Contract with the successful Consultant, inform all the other Consultants whose Proposal was
technically responsive that they have been unsuccessful.
(2) The Procuring Entity shall publish in its website, where applicable, the name of the
Consultant to which the Contract was awarded as specified in Schedule II.
(3) Information about award of Contracts exceeding the amount specified in Schedule II
shall be posted on the CPTU’s website.

(3) Make sure that Tender Opening Committee (TOC) members are present;
(4) Check presence of intending participating Tenderers or their authorized

(6) Sort-out the Tenders in accordance with the IFT and Group/Package;
(7) Enter the names of Tenderers (Tender-wise and Group/Package-wise) in the

permitted unless the corresponding substitution notice contains a valid authorisation to
request the substitution and is read out at Tender opening.
(12) Open Envelopes marked “MODIFICATION” and read out the letter. No Tender
modification shall be permitted unless it contains a valid authorisation;
(13) Tear-open the sealed Tenders one by one (tender-wise and Group/ Package-wise)

(16) Discounts offered by any tenderer in accordance with the Tender Document shall be
read out and recorded under ‘Remarks’ of the TOS;
(17) Check the requisite documents, requirements etc., and the Tender Security, in
particular. Write the amount of Tender Security in column-3 of the Tender Opening
Sheet (TOS);
(18) Put the TSN on the Tender Security (Bank Guarantee/Pay Order/Bank Draft) with

Committee (TOC);
132
(19) Record the missing documents or any incompleteness and major or minor
deviations in the appropriate location/pages of the Tender Document as a whole;
(20) If there is no correction in a particular page, write comment at the bottom of that
page that “no correction in this page” or so, as appropriate;
(21) If there is any correction or overwriting in a particular page and duly initialled by the

particular page write comment that “one correction in this page without initial” “two
corrections in this page without initial” and so on, as appropriate;
(23) All red-ink encircled figures and words of the corresponding items and rates must be
initialled by the Chairperson and other members of the TOC;
(24) If there is any item in the Bill of Quantities against which the tenderer has not quoted
any rate and/or amount i.e. kept blank, put question mark in that blank space and at
the bottom of the page write comment that “No rate and/or amount quoted for item
no ……….. in this page”;
(25) Obtain signature of the Tenderers and/or their authorized representatives in the
TOS;
(26) Make sure after opening of the Tenders that all the members and the Chairperson
of the TOC including the Tenderers or their authorized representatives who

General Considerations for the Employment of Consultants
(1) Appointment of Consultants, local or international, at times is a crucial element in the
project cycle. Depending on the nature of a project, combination of both local and
international Consultants in implementing any project or activity can be more useful
and effective. A project may not be ready for financing without Consultant’s Services.
An aid agreement may not be effective till a Consultant is in place. A tender
document may not be issued or even prepared without a Consultant. A system may
not be introduced or reformed without the Services of Consultant. At the conceptual
or project preparation stage it is to be thoroughly scrutinized to identify the areas
where the Services of the Consultant is necessary if the technology involved is
complex and not locally available and the concerned agency has no experience.
Therefore, where it is considered expedient that the service of a Consultant is
required, appointment of local or international Consultants should be considered.
However, the Procuring Entities should be selective in appointment of Consultants.
International Consultants may be appointed when local expertise is not available.
While using international Consultants arrangements should be made to ensure a
mechanism for transfer of technology or expertise. Human resources development
should form an integral part of any technical assistance programme.
(2) Consultants are generally appointed for the following purposes:
(a) Pre-investment Studies: These comprise the investigations that normally
precede decisions to go forward with specific projects. These studies
determine the investment needs and the type of interventions needed to
attain the desired goal. These include identification of priority area of
investment, need for policy adjustment, feasibility studies for project or
programme, improvement of existing management practices etc.
(b) Preparation Services: These comprise the technical, economic or other
assignment required to fully define a project and prepare it for implementation.
These Services normally include the preparation of a project, collection of
relevant Documents, information and data, setting objectives, identifying
activities for attaining objectives, requirement of physical and financial
resources, preparation of Procurement Documents.
(c) Implementation Services: These relate to actual implementation of the
activities using resources already identified during preparation phase.
Implementation shall follow the time chart already worked out and revised
from time to time. Implementation may be of the nature of construction of a
complex road, building or a bridge, Procurement and installation of goods and
equipment. It may be of the nature of reforming a system in order to improve
efficiency and ensure better performance. This involves supervision,
management, inspection and providing necessary technical Services.
(d) Technical Assistance: These comprise a wide range of intellectual and
professional Services along with other support service, such as development
and sector planning and institution building, including organization and
management (O&M) studies, staffing requirement and training needs and
assistance in the implementation of study recommendations.
(3) Technical Assistance Projects have a clearly stated policy to build local capacity in
course of execution of the projects. The objective is to facilitate transfer of knowledge
and technology through the interaction between international and local Consultants
during the implementation of the project.
(4) For each position created in consulting service appropriate attention should be made
to compatible international/ local positions. International Consultants can be of any
147
national of eligible countries including Bangladesh.
a. Association of Consultants with International & Local Consulting Firms:
(1) For development projects implemented in Bangladesh by the GOB with the support
of development partners, may require the engagement of international consulting
firms. Each international consulting firm is encouraged to seek participation and
obtain full range of expertise by associating with local consulting firm(s) or entities in
a joint venture or sub-consultancy, as appropriate.
(2) International consulting firms may include national Consultants in their payroll and
are entitled to apply their Fees/Charges for the local Consultants provided they are
recruited as their team.
(3) The local consulting firms will have local Consultants in their payroll and are entitled
to apply their Fees/Charges on the local Consultants working for them.
(4) If a Bangladeshi firm is short-listed to compete with international firms, it may use the
Services of both international and local Consultants and is entitled to apply
Fees/Charges for both categories of Consultants.
(5) In a joint participation of international and local consulting firms member firms will
mutually decide the payroll arrangements.
b. Billing Rates and Modus Operandi:
(1) Billing rates shall be calculated on staff-month basis. The billing rates of consulting
firms usually consist of staff remuneration, social charges, overhead charges, and
the Consultant’s fee.
(2) The billing rate will vary depending on the nature of the consulting firm. As guidance,
an example of typical billing rate calculation is provided below:
Item Component International/ National Firm
