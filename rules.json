(21) For the purpose of evaluation of Tenders involving domestic preference under Rule\n83(2), the procedure shall be as follows:\n(a) the price quoted for Goods in Tenders from Group A shall be ex-works with or\nwithout transportation and shall include all duties and taxes paid or payable on\nthe basic materials or components purchased in the domestic market or\nimported, but exclude the sales and similar taxes on the finished product;\n(b) the price quoted for Goods in Tenders of Group B shall be on CIP or CIF, as\nspecified in the Tender Document, which is exclusive of customs duties and\nother import duties already paid or to be paid;\n(c) the lowest evaluated Tender price from each group shall be compared;\n(d) if a Tender from Group A is the lowest, that Tender shall be recommended for\naward;\n(e) if a Tender from Group B has the lowest evaluated Tender price, then it shall be\nfurther compared with the lowest evaluated Tender price in Group A and before\nthe final comparison is made, the lowest evaluated Tender price in Group B\nshall be increased by the percentage for ‘domestic preference’ specified in\nSchedule II excluding VAT; and\n(f) the lowest evaluated Tender price in Group A shall then be compared with the\nlowest evaluated Tender price in Group B and the lowest Tenderer shall be\nrecommended for award.

Example\nOne of the factors affecting economic value may be the delivery schedule for Goods\nor completion schedule for Works. If the delivery or completion schedule for Goods or\nWorks specified in the Tender Documents is between fifteen (15) and eighteen (18)\nmonths, and a Tenderer bases his or her Tender price on a delivery of twenty (20)\nmonths, then that Tender price may be adjusted for evaluation purpose only, if it is so\nspecified in the Tender Document, by adding a certain percentage or a lump sum\namount to the Tender price , whereby the percentage or amount for liquidated\ndamages may be considered as a guidance, for the two (2) month delay beyond\neighteen (18) months.",

Example 1\nA Tenderer has personnel and equipment and has just completed another\ncontract near the proposed work site. Example 2\nA Tenderer has particular interest in keeping his or her workforce employed\nduring a low business season. (25) If, after completing the evaluation, it is found that the lowest evaluated Tender is\nsignificantly higher than the official estimate or available budget or both, but is within an\nacceptable range of the market price levels, the TEC may recommend to the Approving Authority\neither to accept the Tender, subject to availability of budget or to advise the Procuring Entity to\nreduce the scope of the requirements for the concerned Procurement or a reallocation of risks and\nresponsibility which can be reflected in a reduction of the contract price.

Example 1\nThe road authority would recommend reducing the scope of work by\ndeleting entirely the road safety items which are the last in the BOQ. A\ncomparison of the impact of these items examined for all responsive\nTenderers may result in the 4th lowest evaluated Tenderer becoming\nthe lowest.

Methods for Procurement of Intellectual and Professional Services and their\nUse. |— 1) The prime consideration in the selection of the successful Consultant in the\nProcurement of intellectual and professional Services shall be given to the quality of a Consultant's\nTechnical Proposal. (2) The cost of the Services shall be considered judiciously because in the Procurement\nof intellectual and professional Services in general, if cost considerations predominate in the\nevaluation, the quality of the resulting Services often ends up being inferior which in turn places\nfurther cost burdens on the Procuring Entity due to rework being needed or less economical\nsolutions being recommended.",

(4) Depending on the nature and complexity of assignments, different methods as\nspecified in this part of these Rules may be used, but the following two (2) methods shall be the\npreferred options for selection of Consultants -\n(a) Quality & Cost Based Selection (QCBS) is the preferred method that shall be\nused in most cases and shall take into account-\n(i) the quality of the Proposal; and\n(ii) the cost of the Services. (b) Selection under a Fixed Budget (SFB) is appropriate only when -\n(i) the assignment is relatively simple and can be precisely defined; and\n(ii) the budget is fixed.

(ii) The Procuring Entity shall use the procedures specified in Rule 107. (b) Selection Based on Consultant’s Qualifications (SBCQ)\n89\n(i) The Procuring Entity may consider using SBCQ for very small\nassignments, for which the cost of a full-fledged selection process would\nnot be justified, such as -\na. brief evaluation studies at critical decision points of projects\n(review of alternative solutions with large downstream effects);\nb. executive assessment of strategic plans;\nc. high level, short-term legal expertise; and\nd. participation in project review expert panels. (ii) The Procuring Entity shall use the procedures specified in Rule 108. (c) Selection amongst Community Service Organisations (CSOs)\n(i) may be used by short-listing reputable Non-Governmental Organisations\n(NGOs), other community service organisations or voluntary non-profit\norganisations that are well qualified to assist in the preparation, management\nand implementation of community development projects or programmes\nbecause of their involvement and knowledge of local issues, community needs\nor participatory approaches.",

Depending on the nature of a project, combination of both local and\ninternational Consultants in implementing any project or activity can be more useful\nand effective. A project may not be ready for financing without Consultant’s Services. An aid agreement may not be effective till a Consultant is in place. A tender\ndocument may not be issued or even prepared without a Consultant. A system may\nnot be introduced or reformed without the Services of Consultant. At the conceptual\nor project preparation stage it is to be thoroughly scrutinized to identify the areas\nwhere the Services of the Consultant is necessary if the technology involved is\ncomplex and not locally available and the concerned agency has no experience. Therefore, where it is considered expedient that the service of a Consultant is\nrequired, appointment of local or international Consultants should be considered. However, the Procuring Entities should be selective in appointment of Consultants. International Consultants may be appointed when local expertise is not available. While using international Consultants arrangements should be made to ensure a\nmechanism for transfer of technology or expertise. Human resources development\nshould form an integral part of any technical assistance programme. (2) Consultants are generally appointed for the following purposes:\n(a) Pre-investment Studies: These comprise the investigations that normally\nprecede decisions to go forward with specific projects.",

The objective is to facilitate transfer of knowledge\nand technology through the interaction between international and local Consultants\nduring the implementation of the project. (4) For each position created in consulting service appropriate attention should be made\nto compatible international/ local positions. International Consultants can be of any\n147\nnational of eligible countries including Bangladesh. a. Association of Consultants with International & Local Consulting Firms:\n(1) For development projects implemented in Bangladesh by the GOB with the support\nof development partners, may require the engagement of international consulting\nfirms. Each international consulting firm is encouraged to seek participation and\nobtain full range of expertise by associating with local consulting firm(s) or entities in\na joint venture or sub-consultancy, as appropriate.
